Create Boot able USB Flash Drive

Steps

>> Insert a usb drive at least 4gb in size

>> Open command prompt as administrator

>> Run diskpart

      C:\Windows\system32> diskpart

>> Run list disk
            DISKPART> list disk

            Disk ### Status Size Free Dyn Gpt

            Disk 0 Online 238 GB 0 B
            Disk 1 Online 465 GB 0 B
            Disk 2 Online 29 GB 0 B

>> Select your flash drive by running select disk #
   DISKPART> select disk 2

Disk 2 is now the selected disk.

>> Run clean
            WARNING: This deletes all data on your drive
            DISKPART> clean

>> Create a partition
            DISKPART> create partition primary

>> Select the new partition
            Since we know there is only one partition, we can just run this:

            DISKPART> select partition 1

>> Format the partition
            To format it, we’ll use the NTFS file system and run a quick format:
            DISKPART> format fs=ntfs quick

>> Set the current partition as Active
            Run: DISKPART> active

>> Exit diskpart
            Run exit. This will exit diskpart, but leave the command window open.

Mount your ISO
Use Virtual CloneDrive or similar.

Navigate to the mounted image and install a bootsector
My ISO is mounted as G:, so I’ll navigate to G:\boot and run:

C:Windowssystem32> G:
G:> cd boot
G:\boot> bootsect.exe /nt60 E:
Where E:\ in this case is my flash drive’s letter.

Copy the entire contents of the ISO to your flash drive
You can either do this from Windows using Ctrl+C+Ctrl+V, or from the command line using xcopy.
G:> xcopy g:*.* e:\ /E /H /F
/E copies all subfolders, /H copies all hidden files and /F displays all source and destination file names as it’s copying.

Once that’s done, go and install Windows!
