Create Boot able USB Flash Drive

Steps

Insert a usb drive at least 4gb in size

Open a command prompt as administrator
Hit Windows Key, type cmd and hit Ctrl+Shift+Enter. This will force it to open as admin.

Run diskpart
This will open and run the Diskpart command line utility, which allows you to manage disks, partitions and volumes.

C:\Windows\system32> diskpart

Run list disk
This will list all disks on your system. You’ll see the something similar to this:
DISKPART> list disk

Disk ### Status Size Free Dyn Gpt

Disk 0 Online 238 GB 0 B
Disk 1 Online 465 GB 0 B
Disk 2 Online 29 GB 0 B

Select your flash drive by running select disk #
Find the item that corresponds with your flash drive and select the disk. In the example above, my flash drive is disk 2 so I’ll run:
DISKPART> select disk 2

Disk 2 is now the selected disk.

Run clean
WARNING: This deletes all data on your drive
The clean command marks all data on the drive as deleted and therefore removes all partitions and volumes. Make sure you want to do this! If you are sure, run:
DISKPART> clean

Create a partition
DISKPART> create partition primary

Select the new partition
Since we know there is only one partition, we can just run this:

DISKPART> select partition 1
Without checking the partition number. If you’re really curious, run list partition to check.

Format the partition
To format it, we’ll use the NTFS file system and run a quick format:
DISKPART> format fs=ntfs quick

Set the current partition as Active
Run:
DISKPART> active

Exit diskpart
Run exit. This will exit diskpart, but leave the command window open.

Mount your ISO
Use Virtual CloneDrive or similar.

Navigate to the mounted image and install a bootsector
My ISO is mounted as G:, so I’ll navigate to G:\boot and run:

C:Windowssystem32> G:
G:> cd boot
G:\boot> bootsect.exe /nt60 E:
Where E:\ in this case is my flash drive’s letter.

Copy the entire contents of the ISO to your flash drive
You can either do this from Windows using Ctrl+C+Ctrl+V, or from the command line using xcopy.
G:> xcopy g:*.* e:\ /E /H /F
/E copies all subfolders, /H copies all hidden files and /F displays all source and destination file names as it’s copying.

Once that’s done, go and install Windows!
